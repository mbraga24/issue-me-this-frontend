## Description

I decided to build an app similar to _Stack Overflow_ for all of those who have already mastered or still learning programming can help and collaborate with each other. On _Issue Me This_  users can post Issues with questions with code snippets, other users can leave comments to try to help them, like, dislike and favorite someone elseâ€™s issue post for future reference. I built this app with the intent to solidify foundational skills on React as well as Rails as an API.
